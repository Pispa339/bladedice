# BladeDice

New version(/remake) of BladeDice app.

BladeDice is a random trick generator for a game of B.L.A.D.E (aggressive inline version of game of S.K.A.T.E). 

Found the source of a previous rewrite I had started a few years ago but never got around to finish. I was bored on a flight, picked it up and started fiddling around with it. This repo is just for personal version control purposes. Likely won't be updating this often and it will be in a very scrambled WIP state for most of the time.
